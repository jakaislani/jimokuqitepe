In addition to his acting career, Reedus is a model and artist.</p><p>As for his personal life, there have been rumors circulating online suggesting that Norman Reedus is gay. Many fans on Twitter have regarded Reedus as Gay in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">their tweets</a>.</p><p>But how true are these fan speculations? Let’s know about the actual matter regarding his sexuality in this piece.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Is Norman Reedus gay?</h2><p>Actually, it started from discussing his role in The Walking Dead. Reedus said to the Mirror Online that the show’s writer, Frank Darabont, had first decided his character, Daryl, was supposed to be homosexual.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>“There was a time on the show where Frank was going to have me be gay, but he won’t admit it,” Reedus said. “If he admits it’s like he’ll kill &nbsp;you. He referred to it as ‘prison gay,’ and I didn’t know what that meant.”</p><p>Meanwhile, The Walking Dead&nbsp;has a high percentage of LGBT characters, including the main characters Aaron, Jesus, and Tara, who are openly gay.</p><p>Reedus recalled that conversation occurred in 2010 while he and Darabont were on the way to a party for the film, The Fighter.</p><p>“We were there and he said ‘what do you think if we made Daryl gay?’ and I was like ‘let’s do it, let’s do it!'” he added. “He was like ‘I knew I picked the right guy for this job!'” The plan made in the conversation hasn’t been executed in the show till now.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/norman-reedus-gay-wife-partner.jpg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Norman Reedus during the shoot of ‘The Walking Dead’ (Image Source: Instagram/<a href=# rel=noopener>bigbaldhead</a>)</p><p>With the AMC series now concluding its journey as a TV show, it’s hard to know if that plan will ever be executed. Moreover, Daryl’s sexuality is shown as straight, as he has been involved in a romantic relationship with a couple of ladies in the show.</p><p>That being said, the actor admits that he is open to playing the role of a gay character. In an interview with Conan, Reedus spoke about his role, “If that’s the story they gave me, I would rock that story. I’m not afraid of it.”</p><p>Marvel’s Blade II actor also joked that the rumors only started because Payne, who plays Jesus in the show, wanted his gay role.</p><p>Even though the 54-year-old actor is comfortable playing the role of gay, his sexual orientation is straight in reality; he has been in relationships with straight women so far. His relations with men have not been revealed yet.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Norman Reedus has been in a relationship for more than half a decade now</h2><p>Reedus was in a relationship with supermodel Helena Christensen for five years between 1998 to 2003. They never got married, but they have a son born in 1999.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Tripple 9 actor is currently in a relationship with German actress Diane Kruger. They first met during the film Sky in 2015 and eventually began dating on July 4 of the same year.</p><p>Kruger spoke to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a> during Sky shooting regarding the meeting with Reedus, “I didn’t know him&nbsp;before the film. We share a lot of intimate scenes. I was really nervous about meeting him and not being able to have a drink with him, or talk with him [before filming].”</p><p>Then they both were spotted together several times. In January 2018, they made their red carpet debut, and in May 2018, they announced they were expecting their first baby. In November 2018, they welcomed a beautiful baby girl Nova Tennessee.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Years later, in August 2021, People confirmed that the couple had gotten engaged, and Kruger’s engagement ring was visible during her 2021 Met Gala appearance. As of now, they are still together and engaged.</p><p>To conclude, Reedus is the father of two children and is currently in a healthy relationship with his actress fiancee. Thus, these things can also prove that Reedus isn’t gay and is a straight man.</p><h1 class="mvp-post-title left">Dominic West Grew up with His Six Siblings — Into His Family Background</h1><span class="mvp-post-excerpt left"><p>Dominic West grew up in a wealthy family with many siblings.</p></span><img width=1200 height=720 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Dominic-West-Siblings-1.jpg alt="Dominic West Grew up with His Six Siblings — Into His Family Background" decoding=async sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>English actor <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://glamourbuff.com/actor/dominic-west-children/ rel="noreferrer noopener">Dominic West</a> cherished his formative years in the warmth of a sizable family, surrounded by his six siblings.</p><p>Dominic spent his formative years growing up with six siblings, including five sisters named Georgiana West, Jacinta West, Thomasina West, Edwina West, and Natasha West, along with one brother named Damian West.</p><p>Despite having many siblings in his life, the actor has maintained a private stance, choosing not to divulge information about them or share any pictures of his family on his social media platforms.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Dominic West’s family background</h2><p>Dominic was born on October 15, 1969, to his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">parents</a>, Moya West and George West.

It was unfair of me because he did want to do it, but I wouldn’t have fancied that, to be honest,” he confessed.</p><p>Not much is known about Dominic’s youngest two children, Francis and Christabel.

They have a far broader existence than they would anywhere else in the world.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Dominic West and his wife, Catherine FitzGerald</h2><p>FitzGerald and West fell in love while attending Trinity College in Dublin, Ireland, but their relationship was short-lived. “I fell in love with my wife when I was at university and I managed to persuade her to fall in love with me for about three months but then she ran away and married someone else,” Dominic told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">British Vogue</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>FitzGerald also talked about their love story with the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Irish Independent</a> and said that it would not have been the right decision to settle with him at the time. “We had all the time in the world to explore the pubs and back streets and walk the canal. But at the end of the summer, I left him. And he has not let me forget it! But I couldn’t have settled down with him right then forever. That would not have been a good idea for either of us,” she explained.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>When FitzGerald and Dominic split up, she married Edward Lambton, the 7th Earl of Durham, in 1995, while the actor relocated to the United States to shoot The Wire and had a daughter with Astor.</p><p>FitzGerald and Lambton ended their relationship in 2002, and she and Dominic reconnected the same year. He was taking a year off and returned to London to be with his daughter, and a mutual acquaintance introduced them.&nbsp;</p><p>“We were both, then, at the right time in our lives,” FitzGerald told the Irish Independent. “And it was lovely to have that shared history, from earlier days.”&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>The duo has been together since then.
