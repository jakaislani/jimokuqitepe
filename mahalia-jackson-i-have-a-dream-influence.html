March on Washington for Jobs and Reform, King quickly turned to Jackson.

Jones wrote in <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/01/14/AR2011011406266.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Washington Post" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">The Washington Post</a> in 2011. Still, it wasn’t until mid-August that the first draft was written up by Jones and advisor Stanley Levison.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Even with all that advance planning, 12 hours before the speech, King still wasn’t sure what he would say, as he sat in the lobby of D.C.’s Willard Hotel with his team. “Everyone, it seemed, had a different take,” Jones wrote, saying that some felt it should have an ideological and political reform take, while others felt it should lean more toward a church sermon.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">With so many differing opinions, King asked Jones to draft up an outline. It was then that Jones came up with the opening analogy of “African Americans marching to Washington to redeem a promissory note or a check for justice” and no mention of a “dream.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">When they gathered again, the group started arguing about all the elements that were missing, but King simply took the notes and headed back to his room, leaving them with, “I am now going upstairs to my room to counsel with my Lord.”</p><img alt='A draft of a Martin Luther King speech to the National Press Club with handwritten changes.

He started off with the bad check analogy that Jones had written.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“This was strange, given the way he usually worked over the material Stanley and I provided. When he finished the promissory note analogy, he paused,” <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/01/14/AR2011011406266_3.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jones continued" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Jones continued</a>. “And in that breach, something unexpected, historic and largely unheralded happened.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">That was when Jackson spontaneously shouted, “Tell ‘em about the dream, Martin, tell ‘em about the dream!”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">At that moment, everything changed. “I see that what he does when he hears her shout that to him,” Jones, who says he was standing 50 feet behind King, told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/local/dr-clarence-b-jones-on-i-have-a-dream-speech/2013/08/21/005c484a-0aa9-11e3-9941-6711ed662e71_video.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Washington Post" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">The Washington Post</a>. “He then takes the papers on the lectern and he moves the papers to the left. And then he grabs the lectern on the podium, so I turn to some unknown person next to me and I said, ‘These people don’t know it, but they’re about ready to go to church.’”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Sure enough, King went completely off books. “He was speaking spontaneously and extemporaneously,” Jones said. “His whole body language shifted, became more relaxed, and then as some baptist preachers do, he would take his right foot and started putting it up against his left leg, some preachers do that as they’re talking... and I said, ‘This man is going to preach now.’”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">That’s exactly what happened next. Inspired by those words from Jackson, King turned back to the dream. Instead of looking down at his notes, he spoke from his heart — engraving that famous dream into the American history books.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“I say to you today, my friends, so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream,” <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.naacp.org/i-have-a-dream-speech-full-march-on-washington/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="he said" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">he said</a>. “It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream. I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed, ‘We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.’”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The more he spoke about the dream, the more people felt the message. And now, the speech itself is best known as the “I Have a Dream” speech.</p><img alt='Martin Luther King Jr. delivers his famous "I Have a Dream" speech in front of the Lincoln Memorial during the March on Washington on August 28, 1963' title='Martin Luther King Jr. delivers his famous "I Have a Dream" speech in front of the Lincoln Memorial during the March on Washington on August 28, 1963' width=3556 height=2387 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-517357504.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">Martin Luther King Jr. delivers his famous "I Have a Dream" speech in front of the Lincoln Memorial during the March on Washington on August 28, 1963; Photo: Bettmann/Getty Images</span></p><h2 data-node-id=37 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">King acknowledged Jackson’s role</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=38 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The moment that Jackson had cried out, as if at a church service, Jones said it was clear that King acknowledged it. “I noticed that when she shouts to him that he looks over to her in real-time momentarily,” Jones told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxlOlynG6FY" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Wall Street Journal" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">The Wall Street Journal</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=39 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Later on, King addressed the impact of the moment. “When I got up to speak, I was already happy,” he <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/jackson-mahalia data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="wrote to Jackson" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">wrote to Jackson</a> on January 10, 1962. “I couldn’t help preaching. Millions of people all over this country have said it was my greatest hour. I do not know, but if it was, you, more than any single person helped to make it so.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=40 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In that same letter, he said she was “a blessing to me” as well as “a blessing to Negroes who have learned through [her] not to be ashamed of their heritage.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=41 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">As for Jackson, it was in her very nature. “What can we do but help each other?” she once said in an interview. “I don’t go to these meetings [that] do a lot of blab blab blabbing. If you’re going to blab, put your money up there — and do something.” And that she did.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGikrquZmLaiutJopJqgkaG2onnJmpqkq5%2Bjeqp5x5qtnmWRYrGzscCmZKKmlqHCprrCng%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./philip-chism-wikipedia-how-old-is-he-now.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Old Is He Now ?">&larr;
