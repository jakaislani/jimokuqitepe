They grew up in a playpen in the dance studio.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">By the age of three, young Swayze was already taking ballet classes — and starting to add on extracurricular activities in every realm throughout his childhood. “He wanted to do everything. He was a skater, a swimmer, involved in all the Little League sports, baseball, football, studied dancing every day, he played the violin, sang in the school choir, did the leads in the school plays from junior high up,” his mother said. “I guess you could call him hyper, but he just has to be busy all the time.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Swayze himself attributed that drive to his mother, having said, “My mother has so many abilities on so many levels. She was an ice skater, she was a roller skater, she was a swimmer, she was a gymnast, she was a diver, she was a dancer. She wanted all of us to achieve those same levels and hopefully surpass her. We weren’t long on having much free time in my household.”</p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">He was bullied for being a dancer</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">As he reached his teen years, balancing all the activities became more challenging and he especially got taunted for his dancing.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“He had his dance shoes in one hand and a violin in the other and these three boys were waiting for him,” his brother Don Swayze told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/patrick-swayze-full-biography-2174128890 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Biography class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Biography</a> of a particular school incident. “[They] said something to the effect of ‘Hey, twinkle your toes for us, pretty boy.’”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">His mother was always there with advice. “I said, ‘Just take the ballet shoes out of your hip pocket and beat the snuff out of them,’ so he went to the coach and went to the gym and asked to see them one by one with the boxing gloves, and I, frankly, think that ended that.”</p><img alt="Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey in Dirty Dancing" title="Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey in Dirty Dancing" width=5341 height=3516 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-948024224.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">Jennifer Grey and Patrick Swayze in "Dirty Dancing"; Photo: Getty Images</span></p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Swayze's mother 'could be very violent'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">While his mother’s advice may not have been the peaceful way to end things, that reportedly wasn’t the only incident of her tough nature.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“One thing you didn’t do was cross Patsy,” Swayze’s childhood friend Larry Ward told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/patrick-swayze-full-biography-2174128890 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Biography class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Biography</a>. “When Patsy said be in by midnight, by golly, don’t make it 12:01 or she’d have this finger right here cocked and loaded.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Her strict nature came to a peak on Swayze’s 18th birthday when she was “laying into him,” as his widow Lisa Niemi, reveals in a new documentary, I Am Patrick Swayze. While she didn’t get into the specifics of the reportedly abusive incident, Swayze’s father, Jesse, stepped in and said he would file for divorce if she ever repeated any threats like that. Niemi <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__people.com_movies_patrick-2Dswayze-2Dwidow-2Dlisa-2Dreveals-2Dpainful-2Dsecrets-2Dchildhood-2Ddocumentary_&d=DwMFaQ&c=bHpC9irXhivtSwyVyKc43lLt4-cAwmmH7TeQLPqTb5E&r=x9xxWeVzkXIXknX_X9l8B7bP7RktNKcSnGjZayEcxWM&m=kn_NSaoQC3OjK5uXCZ_7LY2o669QunikJPl7jelbbY8&s=KzjxFuUecU6BvomPA7wM4nt9PcEvjkctl2SIXMf1bkA&e=" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=told class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">told</a> <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__people.com_movies_patrick-2Dswayze-2Dwidow-2Dlisa-2Dreveals-2Dpainful-2Dsecrets-2Dchildhood-2Ddocumentary_&d=DwMFaQ&c=bHpC9irXhivtSwyVyKc43lLt4-cAwmmH7TeQLPqTb5E&r=x9xxWeVzkXIXknX_X9l8B7bP7RktNKcSnGjZayEcxWM&m=kn_NSaoQC3OjK5uXCZ_7LY2o669QunikJPl7jelbbY8&s=KzjxFuUecU6BvomPA7wM4nt9PcEvjkctl2SIXMf1bkA&e=" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=People class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">People</a>, “She never hit him after that.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">But in the documentary, Niemi does note that it was exactly what happens in “families with a cycle of abuse.” She went on to say that his mother “could be very violent, but it was nothing compared to what she endured growing up and the stories I heard about what she went through with her own mother.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“He always thought Mom was so strict and so hard on him,” his brother Don added in the documentary. “But the way I saw it she just used that to spur him on. He was everything to my mother.” Niemi, who met Swayze as a dancer in his mother’s studio when she was 15 and married him in 1975, did go on to add, “He became very aware of the positive and the negative aspects of how he was raised...if somebody pushes you that hard, like his mom did, it could make some people cave, but it made him fight harder.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“She was a complicated woman, intense and an amazing life force,” Niemi said to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/movies/patrick-swayze-widow-lisa-reveals-painful-secrets-childhood-documentary/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=People class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">People</a>. ”Patrick absolutely loved and respected her.”</p><h2 data-node-id=23 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">The dancer almost had his leg amputated</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The same year of the reported incident with his mom when he was 18, he suffered a major injury to his left leg during the second to last football game of his senior year. While he had been leaning toward choosing the gridiron over the arts, the incident led him to transfer his energy to gymnastics — and use dance as a method of therapy to strengthen his body.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Finding success in the dance world, he trained with the Harkness and Joffrey Ballet companies in New York City and became a principal dancer with the Eliot Feld Ballet Company.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">But then another health setback came. In 1976, what started as a tooth abscess led to a staph infection in his bloodstream, which unfortunately settled right in his bad leg. There was only one week for doctors to take action before it needed to be amputated, but fortunately, he was saved. “That was a miraculous one to make it through,” Swayze said.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Having conquered one challenging setback over another, he eventually found his way to Broadway stardom and then the big screen — leaving a lasting impression as one of the greatest dancers who ever graced the silver screen.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGiYnKyfp8BwvMCtqaKbm2LAuK3Ys5xmoZ6fwrPFjJ2Yp5uZo7Q%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./annie-murphy-2.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Annie Murphy Age, Net Worth, Husband, Family &amp;amp; Biography">&larr;
