In 2021, she became the<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" onclick="return phoenixTrackClickEvent(this,event)"> youngest</a> poet to write and read her work at a presidential inauguration. The 22-year-old enthralled the Biden inauguration audience with "The Hill We Climb," which <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" onclick="return phoenixTrackClickEvent(this,event)">referenced</a> both painful history and hope for the future. Gorman also read a poem at the Super Bowl in 2021, co-hosted 2021's Met Gala and was named an Estée Lauder Global Changemaker. In addition to poetry, Gorman is an activist who<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" onclick="return phoenixTrackClickEvent(this,event)"> advocates</a> for climate issues, equality and education. She's been<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" onclick="return phoenixTrackClickEvent(this,event)"> interested</a> in a presidential run since she was 11, and plans to run in 2036, the first cycle in which she'll be old enough to be elected. Prior to performing, Gorman<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" onclick="return phoenixTrackClickEvent(this,event)"> recites</a> the following mantra: "I'm the daughter of Black writers who are descended from Freedom Fighters who broke their chains and changed the world. They call me."</p><h2 id=early-life>Early Life</h2><p>Amanda Gorman was born on March 7, 1998, in Los Angeles, California, to Joan Wicks. She and twin sister Gabrielle were born prematurely.</p><p>Gorman grew up with a speech impediment and was<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" onclick="return phoenixTrackClickEvent(this,event)"> diagnosed</a> with an auditory-processing disorder in kindergarten. This meant she had trouble pronouncing the letter "r" until she was<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" onclick="return phoenixTrackClickEvent(this,event)">around 20</a>. Gorman<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" onclick="return phoenixTrackClickEvent(this,event)"> explained</a> in an interview with <a href=#>Oprah Winfrey</a>, "I was born early, along with my twin, and a lot of times, for infants, that can lead to learning delays."</p><p>Gorman participated in speech therapy. She also found the Hamilton soundtrack to be a useful tool in pronouncing "r" sounds. "I would listen to the track of 'Aaron Burr, Sir,' and try to do it over and over and over again," she<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" onclick="return phoenixTrackClickEvent(this,event)">said</a>.</p><p>Her situation presented<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" onclick="return phoenixTrackClickEvent(this,event)"> difficulties</a>, but also had benefits. Gorman <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" onclick="return phoenixTrackClickEvent(this,event)">shared with Winfrey</a>, "I think it made me all that much stronger of a writer when you have to teach yourself how to say words from scratch. When you are learning through poetry how to speak English, it lends to a great understanding of sound, of pitch, of pronunciation, so I think of my speech impediment not as a weakness or a disability, but as one of my greatest strengths."</p><h2 id=education>Education</h2><p>Gorman grew up in West Los Angeles and attended the private progressive school New Roads in Santa Monica. As her mother taught middle-school English in Watts, Gorman<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" onclick="return phoenixTrackClickEvent(this,event)"> learned</a> about disparities in educational opportunity.</p><p>Gorman was a youth delegate for the United Nations when<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" onclick="return phoenixTrackClickEvent(this,event)"> she was 16</a>. She attended Harvard University, where she majored in sociology. Gorman graduated cum laude, remotely due to the Covid-19 pandemic, in 2020.</p><h2 id=writing-and-poetry>Writing and Poetry</h2><p>By the time she was 5, Gorman would wake her mother early in the morning because she<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" onclick="return phoenixTrackClickEvent(this,event)"> wanted</a> paper to write.<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" onclick="return phoenixTrackClickEvent(this,event)"> Hearing</a> the poem "Dandelion Wine" by <a href=#>Ray Bradbury</a> in third grade was another early link to her love of poetry. However, Gorman<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" onclick="return phoenixTrackClickEvent(this,event)"> said</a> in 2021, "I actually started writing poetry before I started reading it, mostly because at the time poetry wasn’t something that was taught robustly in my classrooms."</p><p>In middle school, Gorman read poems by Sonia Sanchez, which she<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" onclick="return phoenixTrackClickEvent(this,event)"> adored</a>. Then diving into Angles of Ascent: A Norton Anthology of African American Poetry left Gorman feeling even more connected to poetry. She further<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" onclick="return phoenixTrackClickEvent(this,event)"> developed</a> her love of writing with mentors from the nonprofit organization WriteGirl. She went on to perform for WriteGirl, The Moth and Urban Word.</p><p>At the age of 16, Gorman was named L.A. Youth Poet Laureate. She became the first National Youth Poet Laureate in 2017. Her organization One Pen One Page was founded to promote<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" onclick="return phoenixTrackClickEvent(this,event)"> youth literacy</a> and<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" onclick="return phoenixTrackClickEvent(this,event)"> creativity</a>.</p><p>Gorman's work has been published in The One for Whom Food Is Not Enough (2015), The Hill We Climb: An Inaugural Poem for the Country (2021), and Call Us What We Carry (2021). The poetry in Call Us What We Carry draws on the<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" onclick="return phoenixTrackClickEvent(this,event)"> experience</a> of living through the Covid-19 pandemic. Gorman also researched events like the 1918 flu pandemic for her work.</p><p>Gorman has penned the children's book Change Sings: A Children's Anthem (2021). She<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" onclick="return phoenixTrackClickEvent(this,event)"> described</a> it as a "poetic rallying cry for kids who want to make a difference."</p><p>Another Gorman <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" onclick="return phoenixTrackClickEvent(this,event)">interest</a> is in writing novels."Novel writing was my original love, and I still hope to do it. I just typically can finish writing a single poem faster than I can an entire narrative book!"<u></u></p><h2 id=inaugural-poem-the-hill-we-climb>Inaugural Poem: "The Hill We Climb"</h2><p>Dr. <a href=#>Jill Biden</a>, who'd seen Gorman perform,<a href=# rel=noopener onclick="return phoenixTrackClickEvent(this,event)">suggested</a> Gorman write a poem for the inauguration of President <a href=#>Joe Biden</a> and Vice President <a href=#>Kamala Harris</a>. At the end of December 2020, the Biden Inaugural Committee invited Gorman to perform at the inauguration.</p><p>To prepare for this, Gorman read speeches by <a href=#>Frederick Douglass</a>, <a href=#>Winston Churchill</a>, <a href=#>Abraham Lincoln</a> and <a href=#>Martin Luther King Jr.</a> She also studied the work of previous inaugural poets such as <a href=#>Maya Angelou</a>, a longtime<a href=# rel=noopener onclick="return phoenixTrackClickEvent(this,event)">inspiration</a> for her, and Elizabeth Alexander.</p><p>Gorman added lines to her poem following the January 6 insurrection at the Capitol. Shetold the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" onclick="return phoenixTrackClickEvent(this,event)">Los Angeles Times</a>, "I crafted an inaugural poem that recognizes these scars and these wounds. Hopefully, it will move us toward healing them."</p><p>On January 20, 2021, Gorman wore a yellow coat, her<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" onclick="return phoenixTrackClickEvent(this,event)"> trademark color</a>, with her hair crowned by a red Prada headband. She also sported a caged-bird ring, which had been gifted to her by Winfrey, in honor of Angelou. Gorman then<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" onclick="return phoenixTrackClickEvent(this,event)"> mesmerized</a> the audience at the inauguration, and those watching elsewhere, with "The Hill We Climb."</p><h2 id=career>Career</h2><p>Prior to 2021, Gorman had <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" onclick="return phoenixTrackClickEvent(this,event)">shared her poetry</a> at the <a href=#>Obama</a> White House, the Library of Congress and Lincoln Center. However, her unforgettable performance at the Biden-Harris inauguration brought Gorman to a new level of fame.</p><p>Post-inauguration, Gorman read a poem, "Chorus of the Captains," at the Super Bowl in 2021. That appearance had <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" onclick="return phoenixTrackClickEvent(this,event)">been in the works</a> before her breakthrough inauguration performance, but Gorman has received numerous other offers since then. Shetold <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" onclick="return phoenixTrackClickEvent(this,event)">Vogue</a>, "I have to be conscious of taking commissions that speak to me." Fortunately, she has mentors in her life like Winfrey, who has provided Gorman with advice since their meeting on John Krasin­ski's YouTube show Some Good News in May 2020.</p><p>Gorman has signed with IMG Models, appeared on the cover of Vogue&nbsp;and<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" onclick="return phoenixTrackClickEvent(this,event)"> inked</a> a three-year deal with Estée Lauder to be its first Global Changemaker. In that role, Gorman will appear in ads while also curating grants to promote literacy for women and girls.</p><p>Gorman also co-hosted the 2021 Met Gala, along with <a href=#>Timothée Chalamet</a>, <a href=#>Billie Eilish</a> and <a href=#>Naomi Osaka</a>. At the event she appeared in an outfit inspired by the Statue of Liberty.</p><p>At the end of 2021, Gorman's poem "A New Day's Lyric" was released on Instagram's official account to herald the new year of 2022. Gorman<a href=# rel=noopener onclick="return phoenixTrackClickEvent(this,event)"> felt</a> the endeavor would help raise money for the International Rescue Committee, with Instagram contributing <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" onclick="return phoenixTrackClickEvent(this,event)">$50,000</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGiuq6Gkmr9wrcyapZ2ZXZy8s7nApw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./judy-nugent.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Judy Nugent">&larr;
